* Read the problem carefully
In problem 193 (Graph Coloring) a lot of time was wasted because I had
not notice the difference between black and white nodes (white nodes
can be connected to each other).

* Think about algorithm 
In problem 193, first I missed that colors should be propagated. Then
I missed that candidates were only 'black' and 'white'.

* C: dynamic memory allocation in functions
I declared an array as `int x[num];' with `num' being a global
variable. It compiled, but turned out that no memory is allocated to
this array. For this either use constant for array size, or allocate
on heap.
