* Read the problem carefully
In problem 193 (Graph Coloring) a lot of time was wasted because I had
not notice the difference between black and white nodes (white nodes
can be connected to each other).

* Think about algorithm 
In problem 193, first I missed that colors should be propagated. Then
I missed that candidates were only 'black' and 'white'.

* C: dynamic memory allocation in functions
I declared an array as `int x[num];' with `num' being a global
variable. It compiled, but turned out that no memory is allocated to
this array. For this either use constant for array size, or allocate
on heap.

* C: Initialize arrays
In problem 193, I forgot to initialize global arrays, and that costed
me half a day. I think only static variables are initialized to
default values. Be on the safe side and always initialize.

* Consider the range of output (and intermediate data) In problem 153,
I kept receiving wrong answer because I had used size_t to store
factorial of a large number. This factorial was then divided by
another factorial. The right way to do it was to compute the value of
this division progressively, as otherwise the factorials themselves
would not fit in any normal data type.
